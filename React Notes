React Notes |
===========================================

✅️In React, re-renders happen under several circumstances:

	1. State Changes: When the setState function is called, React schedules a re-render for the component. This applies to both class components using this.setState and function components using the useState hook.

	2. Props Changes: When a component receives new props from its parent component, React will re-render the component to reflect the new props.

	3. Context Changes: If a component consumes context via useContext or Context.Consumer, it will re-render whenever the context value changes.

	4. Force Update: When a component's forceUpdate method is called (in class components), it forces a re-render.

	5. Parent Component Re-renders: When a parent component re-renders, all its child components will also re-render by default, unless shouldComponentUpdate, React.memo, or useMemo is used to prevent this.

	6. useReducer: Similar to useState, when the dispatch function returned by useReducer is called, React schedules a re-render for the component.
	
==================================================================================================================================================================

Additionally, React's reconciliation process determines whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the Virtual DOM representations before and after the re-render (diffing algorithm).

=========================================================
	✅️Optimization Techniques
	To avoid unnecessary re-renders and improve performance, you can use the following techniques:

		1. shouldComponentUpdate: In class components, override this lifecycle method to return false if the component does not need to re-render.

		2. React.memo: For function components, wrap the component with React.memo to prevent re-renders if props have not changed.

		3. useMemo: Memoize expensive calculations within a function component to avoid re-calculating them on every render.

		4. useCallback: Memoize callback functions within a function component to avoid passing new function references on every render.

		5. useSelector: In a Redux setup, use shallow equality checking with useSelector to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

====================================================================================================================================================================

React Has virtual DOM which in memory DOM structure to prevent multi time rendering of element it only render element when some change happen between previous and current state of element --> Reconsilation property 

When react re render --> change in state, component variables etc then

==================================================================================================================================================================


✅️Transpiler

============================
A transpiler is a type of compiler that translates source code written in one programming language into another language at the same level of abstraction. This process is particularly common in modern web development, where developers often use languages or syntactic sugar that needs to be converted into plain JavaScript to be executed by web browsers.

Babel: One of the most popular JavaScript transpilers. It is primarily used to convert ES6/ES7/ES8+ code into ES5, ensuring compatibility with all browsers. Babel also supports JSX syntax used in React.
==================================================================================================================================================================

React Lifecycle:
==========================


✅️✅️Lifecycle Methods
=============================
✅️Mounting (when a component is created and inserted into the DOM)
	✅️constructor(): Initializes state and binds methods.
	✅️static getDerivedStateFromProps(): Sync state to props. Rarely used.
	✅️render(): Returns the JSX to be rendered.
	✅️componentDidMount(): Runs after the component is inserted into the DOM. Ideal for network requests, subscriptions.
✅️Updating (when props or state changes)
	✅️static getDerivedStateFromProps(): Called again with new props.
	✅️shouldComponentUpdate(): Determines if the component should re-render. Defaults to true.
	✅️render(): Returns the JSX to be rendered.
	✅️getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): Captures some information (e.g., scroll position) before the DOM is updated.
	✅️componentDidUpdate(): Runs after the component updates in the DOM. Ideal for DOM manipulations or network requests based on previous state/props.
✅️Unmounting (when a component is removed from the DOM)
	✅️componentWillUnmount(): Cleanup tasks like invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up subscriptions.




============================
✅️✅️Sample Code:           |
============================


import React, { Component } from 'react';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
    console.log('Constructor: Initializes state and binds methods');
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState) {
    console.log('getDerivedStateFromProps: Sync state to props if needed');
    return null; // Return an object to update state or null to do nothing
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('componentDidMount: Component inserted into the DOM');
    // Ideal for network requests, subscriptions
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('shouldComponentUpdate: Determine if re-render is needed');
    return true; // Return false to prevent re-render
  }

  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log('getSnapshotBeforeUpdate: Capture info before DOM updates');
    return null; // Return a value or null
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
    console.log('componentDidUpdate: DOM updated');
    // Ideal for DOM manipulations or network requests based on previous state/props
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log('componentWillUnmount: Cleanup before component removal');
    // Cleanup tasks like invalidating timers, canceling network requests
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    console.log('render: Returns JSX to be rendered');
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;


==========================================================================================================================================
✅️JSX (Javscript XML):
================================
✅️ What? Explain that JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code 
within JavaScript files. It's used to describe the UI structure in React.

✅️ JSX vs JavaScript:
const name = "John";
return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>; // Output: Hello, John

✅️ JSX Syntax Rules:
1. Self-Closing Tags: Explain that JSX requires self-closing tags for elements like <img />, <input />, or <br />, 
which differ from HTML.
2. Class vs className: In JSX, the class attribute is written as className because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
```
<div className="my-class"></div>
```

3.Style Attribute: The style attribute in JSX is different from HTML. Instead of a string, 
it accepts an object with camelCased properties: 

```
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white' }}>Styled Text</div>

```

✅️ JSX Expressions:
1. Embedding Variables: Show how to use variables, functions, and expressions directly inside JSX:

```
const age = 25;
return <p>{age >= 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor'}</p>;
```

2. Conditionals in JSX: Demonstrate conditional rendering with expressions like ternary 
operators and && for conditional inclusion.

```
{isLoggedIn && <p>Welcome back!</p>}
```

✅️JSX Components:
```
function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

✅️ JSX Fragments

```
return (
  <>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </>
);

```

✅️ JSX and Props

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
<Welcome name="Sara" />

```

✅️ JSX with Lists and Keys

const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
return (
  <ul>
    {items.map((item, index) => (
      <li key={index}>{item}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);

✅️ JSX Transpilation


==========================================================================================================================================
✅️What is hook:
================
	1. hooks are the functions to use some react features in functional components
	2. In other words, hooks are functions that make functional Component work like class component
	3. Before react lauched hook there is only one way to use states and react lifecycle is only using react class component.
	4. Hooks are functions that makes functional component work like class component.
	5. Hooks are the way to use lifecycle methods of class component.

=================================================================================================================================================
✅️Types of hooks:
===================

1. ✅️useState:
===================
	--> what?
		--> useState hook is a function to add state in functional component 
	--> What is state --> state is nothing but just values or variables.
	
	Syntax: 
	===========
	-->	const [value, setValue] = useState([defaultValue])
	--> Array destructuring used here there is also object destructuring
	--> ... (spread operator) --> used to copy values from array or object in other array or object
	**--> setValue((prev) => console.log(prev) --> stores previous state automatically
	--> when working with array or object we need to update using above syntax first prev value then newvalue
		--> example 
			function increemntCnt()
		 	{
		 	setDetails((prev) => ({...prev, counter: prev.counter + 1}))
		 	}
	 	
======================================================================================================================
	 	
2. ✅️useEffect:
===================	

--> What is useEffect
	--> useEffect is used to perform side effects in out components.
--> What is side effect?
	--> Side effect are the actions which are performed with the outside world.
	--> We perform a side effect when we need to reach outside of our react components to do something.
	--> Example.(Side effect)
		--> Fetching data from API
		--> updating the DOM document & window
		--> Timer functions setTimeout & setInterval
		
--> Syntax : 
	--> useEffect(callback, [dependencies])
	--> callback --> what to run
	--> dependencies --> when to run
--> It's a combination of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount --> of class component.--> useEffect

--> Types or variations:
	--> useEffect without dependencies 
		--> Example: Change title of page each time when component re-renders
		--> Run on each re-renders.
	--> useEffect with empty dependencies
		--> Run only once 
		--> Run only first render of component.
		--> Example : Fetch data on screen visible.
	--> useEffect with variable
		--> Run on change of state or dependencies.
		
--> Cleanup function:
	--> example when to use
		const [time, setTime] = useState(0);
		useEffect(() => {
			setInterval(() => {
				setTime(time + 1);
			 }, 1000);
		})	
		
		display time	
	--> How to use:
		const [time, setTime] = useState(0);
		useEffect(() => {
			const timer = setInterval(() => {
				setTime(time + 1);
			 }, 1000);
			 
			 // Clean up logic --> Run on unmount of component --> Called when component is unmounted
			 return () => {
			 	cleanInteravl(timer)
			 }
			 
		},)
		
	--> Example use case:  to show working --> To see when clean up function works
		
		const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
		useEffect(() => {
			 console.log("Run useEffect", count);
			 
			 // Clean up logic --> Run on unmount of component --> Called when component is unmounted
			 return () => {
			 	console.log("Clean Run", count);
			 }
			 
		}, [count])
		
		display both using JSX --> Create a button first 
		
		--> When we need to stop repeated side effect when your component unmount then clean up function.
		
	--> Clean up function run on every component unmount and when dependency change it run for previous function call	
		
===========================================================================================================================================================

3. ✅️useContext hook:
=====================

--> useContect hoook is used to manage global data in react application.
--> Like global state, services, themes, user settings
--> Why?
	--> app --> child 1--> child 2--> chil3 --> when we need to pass state from app to depest child component then 
	--> We can use props but it not a good way and its very annoying
--> Used to manage global data in react.
--> if you want to pass dat just for child componnent, then you can use props.
	
--> Steps:
	--> Creating the context
		--> use createContext 
		--> const loginContext = createContext();
	--> Providing the context
		--> <loginContext.Provider value = {value}><childComponents/><loginContext.Provider/>
	--> Consuming the context
		--> Import previously created context
		--> useContext used for this task
		--> const login = useContext(loginContext)
		--> pass context which created in previous step.
	
--> Best practices 	

	--> First create one new file in src called --> context
	--> create a file in that folder for context.
	--> <loginContext.Provider value = {value}>{props.children}<loginContext.Provider/>
	--> Then import that component and inside of that component define children which should have the access to context value.


=============================================================================================================================================================			
4. ✅️useRef hook:
===================

--> Use cases :
	1. useRef is allow us to create mutable variables which ***don't cause re-render --> syntax --> const variableName = useRef([defaultValue]) defaultValue is 		   optional
	2. It is very useFull to direct access DOM element
		--> const reference = useRef();
		--> <div ref = {reference}></div>
		--> reference.current.property
	
--> .current property used for to set or get value.
--> Example : Count how many render happens while typing text in input box
--> Why useRef not useState because useState cause re render but useRef not.


useEffect(() => {
setCount(prev => prev + 1)
}) --> Infinite loop because of state change each time here we need useRef
--> This thing happen without typing anything 

--> const count = useRef(0)
--> count variable is object which have current property
--> useEffect(() => {
	count.current += 1;
    })

=================================================================================================================================================================
	
5. ✅️useReducer
===================
--> what?
	--> useReducer is used to manage state in our react application
	--> In other words, useReducer works like a state mangement tool.
--> What is state management:
	--> state management is used to manage all states of application in simple way.
	--> Always use the useReducer hook when you have a lot of states and methods to handle.
	
--> How to apply?

	const initialState = {count : 0}
	
	const ACTION = {
	
		INCREASE : "increase",
		DECREASE : "decrease"
	
	}
	
	const reducer = (state, action) => {
	
		switch(action.type){
			case INCREASE:
				return {count: state.count + 1
			case DECREASE:
				return {count: state.count - 1
				
			default:
				return state
			}
		}
	
	}
	 
	 const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
	 
	 dispatch({type: INCREASE}) 
	 dispatch({type: DECREASE}) 
	 
	 
==================================================================================================================================================================

6. ✅️useLayoutEffect hook:
=============================

--> useLayoutEffect works exactly the same as useEffect(also the same syntax).
--> useEffect runs after the DOM is printed on the browser.
--> useLayoutEffect runs Before the DOM is printed on the browser.
--> useEffect is Asynchronous
--> useLayoutEffect is Synchronous.
--> Whenever we want to run code before the DOM is printed.
	--> Example: height, width, anything realated to layout
	
--> The most common use case of useLayoutEffect is to get the dimension of the layout.
--> That's why it's name is useLayoutEffect.


workflow:
=================
react calculate this component --> useLayoutEffect --> react print all element on DOM --> useEffect


=================================================================================================================================================================

7. ✅️useMemo Hook:
=======================

--> useMemo hook is used to apply Memoization in react.
--> useMemo is a React Hook that helps optimize performance by memoizing the result 
    of an expensive computation. It allows you to avoid recalculating values unless their dependencies change. 
    This is especially useful when you have complex calculations or functions that should only be recalculated when necessary.
--> What is Memoization?
	--> Memoization is a technique for improving the performance of code.
	--> It is useFull to avoid expensive calculations on every render when the returned value is not change.
	
--> Due to re render expensive function again and again called when not required also.
--> const memoCalculation = useMemo(() => {

		return expensiveFunc(number)

	}, [number])
	
	--> When number change then and then only callback function works
	
--> Same like useEffect but return something but useEffect not return anything.

--> Example
	--> Increment counter + change theme of DOM using some function



UseCase example:

import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [otherState, setOtherState] = useState(false);

  // Simulating a CPU-intensive calculation
  const expensiveCalculation = (num) => {
    console.log('Calculating...');
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {}
    return num * 2;
  };

  // Memoizing the expensive calculation so it only runs when count changes
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(count), [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Expensive Calculated Value: {memoizedValue}</h2>

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOtherState(!otherState)}>
        Toggle Other State
      </button>

      <p>Other state: {otherState ? 'True' : 'False'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExpensiveComponent;


==============================================================================================================================================================

8. ✅️useCallback Hook:
=======================	 

--> useCallback is used to return Memoize function.
--> useCallback is a hook used to memoize functions, preventing them from being recreated 
    on every render unless their dependencies change. This is especially useful when passing functions 
    as props to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
--> It's also useful for preventing functions from being re-created on re-rendering.
--> Example
	--> Increment counter + change theme of DOM using some function
	
--> const calculateTable = () => {

	return someCalculation

}


some code to change theme

return (

	<PrintTable fun = {calculateTable}/>
	button to  toggle theme
)


--> if we run this program it will call PrintTable component as function is created and new value generated but if we click on toggle button also then also it will run calculateTable function due to this PrintTable component again rendered
--> This is expensive operation or need more memory to solve this we use useCallback
--> **useMemo --> return memoized value, cannot pass parameter
--> **useCallback --> return memoized function, can pass parameter calculate(2)

solution :
--------------------
calculateTable --> function
const calculateTable = useCallback((value) => {

	return calculation
}, [number])

calculateTable(2)

--> improve performance



---- Example 

import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

// Child component
const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ handleClick }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent re-rendered');
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Memoize the handleClick function
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <ChildComponent handleClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;


Explaination:
--------------------
1. Now, handleClick is memoized using useCallback and will only be re-created if its dependencies (currently none) change.
2. This ensures that the ChildComponent does not re-render when the parent 
state (count) changes, unless the handleClick function changes.


UseCase Example:

import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

// Child component (no React.memo)
const ChildComponent = ({ handleClick, theme }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent re-rendered');
  return (
    <div style={{ background: theme }}>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('lightblue');

  // Memoize the handleClick function to avoid unnecessary re-creation
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log(`Button clicked, count is ${count}`);
  }, [count]);

  // Toggle theme
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === 'lightblue' ? 'lightcoral' : 'lightblue'));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
      <ChildComponent handleClick={handleClick} theme={theme} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;

export default ParentComponent;

===================================================================================================================================================================
8. ✅️custom Hook:
=======================	
--> Are basically a reusable functions.
--> Own hooks that you create for your own use.
--> In that you can use different inbuild hooks.
--> example useFetch
--> Create customhooks folder
--> file name should start with use


9. Destructuring array and object:

const [a, b, c] = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(a, b, c) --> Output: 1 2 3

const { key, key2 } = {
    key : "Sonu",
    key2 : "ABC"
}

console.log( key, key2 ) --> Output: Sonu ABC

10. Children props:

Add children in which component you want children

<UseRefUseCases>
        <UseCaseCleanUp />
        <UseCasesOfUseEffect/>
</UseRefUseCases>


import React, { useEffect, useState, useRef } from 'react'

function UseRefUseCases(props) {

    
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("props: ", props.children) // children will contain refrence object for  <UseCaseCleanUp />, <UseCasesOfUseEffect/>

    }, [])


    return (
        <div>
		{props.children}  --> Help to run children component if this not done then children component will won't work
        </div>

    )
}

export default UseRefUseCases



9. ✅️Make React app faster:

1. Use lazy loading: --> Component which is heavy to load use lazy loading for it.

steps:
1. const lazyComp  = React.lazy(() => import(../component)
2. Wrap lazy compnent into suspense component

<Suspense fallback={}>
<lazyComp/>
</Suspense>

2. Use useMemo and useCallback to avoid re render of heavy functions
3. When adding event listner then use useEffect and unmount the event by cleanup process



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅️React Memo:
React.memo is a higher-order component (HOC) in React used to optimize the performance of functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. It works similarly to PureComponent for class components but for functional components. Here's a detailed explanation of why and when to use React.memo:
✅️Reasons to Use React.memo:
✅️Prevent Unnecessary Re-Renders:
-> React components re-render whenever their parent re-renders, even if their props haven't changed.
-> React.memo ensures that a functional component only re-renders when its props or state actually change.

Example: 

```
const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <p>Count: {count}</p>;
});

function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <input onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} value={text} />
      <ChildComponent count={count} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

✅️Use with useMemo or useCallback:

--> In cases where you pass memoized values (useMemo) or functions (useCallback) as props, React.memo ensures the receiving component re-renders only when necessary.
Example:

```
const Button = React.memo(({ onClick, label }) => {
  console.log("Button rendered");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const increment = React.useCallback(() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1), []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <Button onClick={increment} label="Increment" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
--> Here, React.memo combined with useCallback ensures that the Button component doesn't re-render unnecessarily.


✅️Avoid Re-renders of Static Data:

✅️Components that rely on static data (like configuration or constant props) benefit from React.memo.
Example:

```
const StaticInfo = React.memo(() => {
  console.log("StaticInfo rendered");
  return <div>Static Information</div>;
});

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <StaticInfo />
    </div>
  );
}
```


✅️Key Considerations:
✅️Shallow Comparison:

-> React.memo performs a shallow comparison of props by default.
-> If props contain complex objects or arrays, use a custom comparison function to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
```
React.memo(Component, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Custom comparison logic
  return prevProps.someProp === nextProps.someProp;
});
```
✅️When Not to Use React.memo:

--> If a component is simple or has negligible rendering overhead, React.memo may introduce unnecessary complexity.
Use it only when re-renders impact performance significantly.
--> State Changes:
--> React.memo doesn't prevent re-renders caused by changes in the component's own state.



# **ForwardRef in React: What, Why, and How?**  
		
		## **🟢 What is `forwardRef`?**  
		`forwardRef` is a React function that allows you to pass a **ref** from a parent component to a child component. Normally, refs only work on **DOM elements**, but `forwardRef` enables refs to be used with custom components.  
		
		## **🟡 Why use `forwardRef`?**  
		By default, when you attach a ref to a custom component, React doesn’t pass it down to its child elements. `forwardRef` solves this problem by explicitly forwarding the ref.  
		
		### **Use cases:**  
		✅ **Accessing a child component’s DOM element** (e.g., focusing an input field).  
		✅ **Interacting with third-party libraries that require a DOM reference**.  
		✅ **Creating reusable UI components (like buttons, inputs) that expose ref-based behavior**.  
		
		---  
		
		## **🟠 How to Use `forwardRef`?**  
		
		### **1️⃣ Basic Example - Forwarding a Ref to an Input Field**  
		```jsx
		import React, { forwardRef, useRef } from "react";
		
		const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
		  return <input ref={ref} {...props} />;
		});
		
		export default function App() {
		  const inputRef = useRef();
		
		  const handleFocus = () => {
		    inputRef.current.focus(); // Focus the input using ref
		  };
		
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} placeholder="Type here..." />
		      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Input</button>
		    </div>
		  );
		}
		```
		💡 **Without `forwardRef`**, `CustomInput` would not expose its input element’s ref to the parent.
		
		---  
		
		### **2️⃣ Using `forwardRef` with Styled Components**  
		If you’re using **styled-components** or another UI library, you may need `forwardRef` to ensure refs are properly passed.  
		```jsx
		import React, { forwardRef, useRef } from "react";
		import styled from "styled-components";
		
		const StyledInput = styled.input`
		  padding: 8px;
		  border: 1px solid #ccc;
		  border-radius: 4px;
		`;
		
		const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
		  return <StyledInput ref={ref} {...props} />;
		});
		
		export default function App() {
		  const inputRef = useRef();
		
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} placeholder="Enter text" />
		    </div>
		  );
		}
		```

		### **3️⃣ Using `forwardRef` with a Function Inside**  
		If you need both `props` and `ref`, remember that `forwardRef` **does not work with arrow functions directly**. Use a function inside it.  
		```jsx
		const MyComponent = forwardRef(function MyComponent(props, ref) {
		  return <div ref={ref}>Hello ForwardRef!</div>;
		});
		```
		---  
		
		### **4️⃣ Using `forwardRef` with `useImperativeHandle` for Custom Methods**  
		Sometimes, you want the **parent to call methods inside a child component** (e.g., reset input).  
		```jsx
		import React, { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from "react";
		
		const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
		  const inputRef = useRef();
		
		  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
		    focus: () => inputRef.current.focus(),
		    clear: () => (inputRef.current.value = ""),
		  }));
		
		  return <input ref={inputRef} {...props} />;
		});
		
		export default function App() {
		  const inputRef = useRef();
		
		  return (
		    <div>
		      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} placeholder="Type here..." />
		      <button onClick={() => inputRef.current.focus()}>Focus</button>
		      <button onClick={() => inputRef.current.clear()}>Clear</button>
		    </div>
		  );
		}
		```
		💡 **Here, `useImperativeHandle` exposes `focus` and `clear` methods to the parent component.**

		## **🔴 Common Mistakes**  
		🚨 **1. Using `forwardRef` with an Arrow Function (Incorrect)**  
		```jsx
		// ❌ This will not work
		const MyComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => <div ref={ref}>Hello</div>);
		```
		✅ **Fix:** Use a normal function inside `forwardRef`.  
		```jsx
		const MyComponent = forwardRef(function MyComponent(props, ref) {
		  return <div ref={ref}>Hello</div>;
		});
		```
		
		🚨 **2. Forgetting to Pass the `ref` to a DOM Element**  
		```jsx
		const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
		  return <input {...props} />; // ❌ Ref is ignored here
		});
		```
		✅ **Fix:** Attach the `ref` to the actual DOM element.  
		```jsx
		const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
		  return <input ref={ref} {...props} />;
		});
		```
		
		---  
		
		## **🔹 When NOT to Use `forwardRef`?**  
		- **If you don’t need direct DOM access** (e.g., when using state instead).  
		- **If a component should remain fully controlled** (e.g., controlled form components).  
		- **If you don’t plan to expose any imperative methods.**  
		
		---  
		
		## **✨ Summary**  
		✅ `forwardRef` allows you to pass refs from a parent to a child component.  
		✅ Useful for **accessing DOM elements inside a custom component**.  
		✅ Works well with **UI libraries, styled-components, and third-party components**.  
		✅ Can be combined with **`useImperativeHandle`** to expose functions like `focus()`.
